Accessing MySQL local user failed. As always, figuring out the cause of the error is the key to the solution. The error message `"using password:NO"`confused me because I thought this has something to do with MySQL password.

```mysql
ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user ['root'@'localhost'](mailto:'root'@'localhost') (using password: NO)
```

What I didn't catch in the error was that I might not create MySQL id in the first place. Follow the below steps to check if you actually create your user id.

```mysql
mysql -u root -p
Enter password

mysql> use mysql;
mysql> select user, host from user;
    +------------------+-----------+
    | user             | host      |
    +------------------+-----------
    | bill             | localhost |
    | debian-sys-maint | localhost |
    | mysql.session    | localhost |
    | mysql.sys        | localhost |
    | root             | localhost |
    +------------------+-----------+
 5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

See if you have your MySQL user id. If not, you bascially created your new user id.

1. Create a new user

```mysql
    mysql> create user 'test'@'localhost' identified by '1111';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> grant all privileges on test_database.* to test@'localhost';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

2. Grant Privileges

```mysql
mysql> grant all privileges on test_database.* to test_grant@'localhost' identified by '1111';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

3. Change Password

```mysql
mysql> UPDATE user set authentication_string=password("my_password1111") WHERE user = 'test';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> flush privileges;
```

4. Delete MySQL

```mysql
mysql> delete from user where user='test';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> delete from user where user='test_grant';
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> flush privileges;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```
